## Current Projects

These are my projects. 

### Hamburger Shooter (SwampHacks 2017 Project)

This is a platform and shooting game I started creating in Unity with two other team members at a hackathon.
I've added more features to it since, including:
1.Spawning enemies
2.Addition of levels with increasing difficulties
3.Music and better control
