## Current Projects

These are my projects. 

### Hamburger Shooter (SwampHacks 2017 Project)

This is a platform and shooting game I started creating in Unity with two other team members at a hackathon.
I've added more features to it since, including:

* Spawning enemies

* Addition of levels with increasing difficulties

* Music and better control
